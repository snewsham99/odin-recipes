    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This amazing cut of beef is definitely a favorite and in my opinion, one of the most flavorful out there. There is no need for special or fancy ingredients, just steaks, seasonings, a brush of oil, and a pat of butter for perfection.</p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring steaks to room temperature and season per the recipe below.</li>
        <li>Heat grill to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Season steaks and grill them between 5 to 7 minutes on each side, depending on the desired done-ness.</li>
        <li>Remove steaks, dot them with butter, and allow them to rest about 5 to 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
